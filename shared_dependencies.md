The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is referenced by all other files that require external packages.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is referenced by all `.tsx` files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is used to initialize pages. It has global imports that are used across all pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is used to augment the application's `<html>` and `<body>` tags. It is referenced by all pages in the application.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are used across all pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is the website's favicon and is used in the `_document.tsx` file.

10. **.gitignore**: This file lists all files and directories that should be ignored by Git. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files but is crucial for version control.

11. **README.md**: This file contains information about the project. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files but is important for documentation.

Please note that the specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not known at this stage.
